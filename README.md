# microservices-with-python-k8s
Application Demonstrates how micro services can be implemented with different message passing techniques. This project refactored the  starter code available at [udacity/nd064-c2-message-passing-projects-starter](https://github.com/udacity/nd064-c2-message-passing-projects-starter)

## Overview
### Background
Conferences and conventions are hotspots for making connections. Professionals in attendance often share the same interests and can make valuable business and personal connections with one another. At the same time, these events draw a large crowd and it's often hard to make these connections in the midst of all of these events' excitement and energy. To help attendees make connections, we are building the infrastructure for a service that can inform attendees if they have attended the same booths and presentations at an event.


### Goal
You work for a company that is building a app that uses location data from mobile devices. Your company has built a [POC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) application to ingest location data named UdaConnect. This POC was built with the core functionality of ingesting location and identifying individuals who have shared a close geographic proximity.

Management loved the POC so now that there is buy-in, we want to enhance this application. You have been tasked to enhance the POC application into a [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) to handle the large volume of location data that will be ingested.

To do so we have to refactor the given application into a microservice architecture using message passing techniques. Priority was to approach the task as an architect and refactor the application into microservices.

Code level optimization, Linting, test cases are marked as todos for the time being.

### Prerequisites
Following tools we need to install in order to setup our environment properly.
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. [Set up a DockerHub account](https://hub.docker.com/)
3. [Set up `kubectl`](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/cluster-access/kubectl/)
4. [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) with at least version 6.0
5. [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation) with at least version 2.0

### Environment Setup
To run the application, you will need a K8s cluster running locally and to interface with it via `kubectl`. We will be using Vagrant with VirtualBox to run K3s.

#### Initialize K3s
In this project's root, run `vagrant up`. 
```bash
$ vagrant up
```

#### Set up `kubectl`
After `vagrant up` is done, you will SSH into the Vagrant environment and retrieve the Kubernetes config file used by `kubectl`. We want to copy the contents of this file into our local environment so that `kubectl` knows how to communicate with the K3s cluster.
```bash
$ vagrant ssh
```
You will now be connected inside of the virtual OS. Run `sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` to print out the contents of the file. You should see output similar to the one that I've shown below. Note that the output below is just for your reference: every configuration is unique and you should _NOT_ copy the output I have below.

Copy the contents from the output issued from your own command into your clipboard -- we will be pasting it somewhere soon!
```bash
$ sudo cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml

Type `exit` to exit the virtual OS and you will find yourself back in your computer's session. Create the file (or replace if it already exists) `~/.kube/config` and paste the contents of the `k3s.yaml` output here.

Afterwards, you can test that `kubectl` works by running a command like `kubectl describe services`. It should not return any errors.

### Steps
1. `kubectl apply -f deployment/db-configmap.yaml` - Set up environment variables for the pods
2. `kubectl apply -f deployment/db-secret.yaml` - Set up secrets for the pods
3. `kubectl apply -f deployment/postgres.yaml` - Set up a Postgres database running PostGIS
4. `kubectl apply -f deployment/person-storage-service` - Set up the Read Api for Person resource
5. `kubectl apply -f deployment/location-storage-service` - Set up the Read Api for Location resource
6. `kubectl apply -f deployment/connection-storage-service` - Set up the Read Api for Connection resource
7. `kubectl apply -f deployment/udaconnect-app` - Set up the service and deployment for the web app
8. `kubectl apply -f deployment/zookeeper-service` - Set up the ZooKeeper as service.
9. `kubectl apply -f deployment/kafka-service` - Set up the kafka queue as service.
10. `kubectl apply -f deployment/location-kafka-consumer` - Set up the Consumer and which will process the message stored in location topic.
11. `kubectl apply -f deployment/person-storage-writer` - Set up the Write Api for Person resource
12. `kubectl apply -f deployment/location-storage-writer-grpc` - Set up the GRPC server for Location resource
13. `sh scripts/run_db_command.sh <POD_NAME>` - Seed your database against the `postgres` pod. (`kubectl get pods` will give you the `POD_NAME`)

Manually applying each of the individual `yaml` files is cumbersome but going through each step provides some context on the content of the starter project. In practice, we would have reduced the number of steps by running the command against a directory to apply of the contents: `kubectl apply -f deployment/`.

Note: The first time you run this project, you will need to seed the database with dummy data. Use the command `sh scripts/run_db_command.sh <POD_NAME>` against the `postgres` pod. (`kubectl get pods` will give you the `POD_NAME`). Subsequent runs of `kubectl apply` for making changes to deployments or services shouldn't require you to seed the database again!

### Verifying it Works
Once the project is up and running, you should be able to see 10 deployments and 10 services in Kubernetes:
`kubectl get pods` and `kubectl get services` - should both return `udaconnect-app`, `postgres`,`zoo1` ,`kafka-service`, `kafka-consumer` & Reader- writer services for Person, location & connection resource.
